   <h1>ASD website home page <br>Welcome to ASD</h1>
  <h2>Start talking about what you are feeling and what you are going through.  Here at ASD, we are here to listen to people who don't have any one 
    to talk to.  No one is ever alone.  There are close to 8 billion ont this earth and none of them are perfect.  Everyone Has their lows and their highs.  No one can 
    be completely free from anxiety, stress, or depression.  People experience these things from hard times and it takes time to heal.  Sometimes it takes talking to start the 
    healing process.
